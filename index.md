# Speed Dating Project

## Dataset
Between 2002 and 2004, professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar ran a series of speed dating events for Columbia University graduate students, while collecting detailed data on the participants and results. The full dataset is available to download; data scientist Keith McNulty has also created a simplified version of [it](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/).

## Major Objectives
- Perform data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation to get various insights about the data
- Get the variables that have a noticeable correlation with 'match'
- Build a model to calculate the pobability of matching with someone taking into consideration the information the user inserts.
- Create a visualization to present the results using different in built packages

## Code and Resources Used
- Python Version: 3.7 
- Packages: pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly, sklearn

# Data Manipulation

After reading the data and inspecting further we found that there are certain columns which needs data manipulation so we did the following steps.
- Some columns had little correlation to 'match' so i eliminated them.
